### Content
My topic for this Freedom Project is going to be makinga Scramble game with Jquery as my Topic, I've decided to use Jquery because I think the code of Jquery is quite similar to Javascript and since I was studying a little about Jquery last year with my webpage, I decided to dive deeper into Jquery and see for myself how much of it I can digest. My Scramble Game would include a simple display value for the words that the user has to guess and there would be 2 buttons that can be pressed if the user wants to refresh the word or check the word that they entered.

### Sources
The main 3 sources that I used in learning Jquery would be [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp), [Jquery home page](https://jquery.com/) and google in general. I might have popped in and out of [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) to test my code whenever I want to change a line of code but is afraid to mess up my overall composition of the code. But, W3schools gave me the most useful and needed resources when I was trying to create a on click function.

### Engineering Design Process
I'm currently at step 2 of the Engineering Design Process which is "Brainstorming Possbile Solution" because I already finished tinkering with my HTML section of my scramble game with was just some `divs` and some `input types` but I didn't really figure out how to layout my Jquery and how to include my Jquery code within the Scramble Game. Therefore, I'm still "Brainstorming" ideas on how to incorporate Jquery in my project in general.

### Skills
The 2 main skills that I learned and developed within this week of tinkering with my tool was "Collaboration" and "Communication". I collaborated with the internet mainly whenever I was stuck on a certain step of my code. For example, when i was trying to think about how to set up the Scramble game to have a clock set up but it would count down as soon as the word refreshes or the game starts and I didn't know how to put that in lines of code. Therefore, I popped into google and searched up "How to decrement a number" as my first step and I caught a glimpse of using the decrement values of a number which is `i--` and I decided to put everything in a `for loop` since it would be continuous over time but if I didn't hop over to google and just instead chose to give up and not even make a time, I wouldn't have learned how to use a for loop or include a for loop in my lines of code to make A COUNT DOWN TIMER. So I collaborated with Googe and FreecodeCamp to resolve my issue. I learned how to communicate by asking one of my senior friends if they knew how to make a count down timer using Jquery but since they didn't choose Jquery as their topic last year, they weren't able to help me but they did give me an insight on how I could use a `for loop` and just using the variable `i`, I could decrement the value until it hits the selected time and then a alert box would pop up for the user to know that the game is over and simply display the word that was supposed to be guessed.
