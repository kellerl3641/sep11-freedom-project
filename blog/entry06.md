### Content
I had given my 1st in class presentation on my freedom project and I have to say, I was a little bit lost for words at the start of the presentation. I did not know what to put as the hook because I wasn't sure if I could attract the audience with that hook and secondly I was nervous at first because I didn't know how to present my code and game. During my presentation, I forgot to asked and interact with the audience when I got to the part where I was displaying my game. I should have asked the audiences to try out the game too instead of me just explaining what each section does. During my Expo-showcase I wasn't as nervous as I was for the class-presentation (I don't exactly know why) because I had prepared myself for the judges and I had practiced my elevator pitch in my room just the night before so I was fully confident in what I was presenting for the judges. One takeaway that I learned from my Expo was the fact that your project does not need to be perfect or the best of all projects, instead you should focus on how you present your project because the way you attract the judges is very important and it can result in further increased chances of the judges loving your project. Not only does the importance of showing your project matter, you also need to learn how to keep the main parts of your project understandable. (The judges should not need to ask you what your tool is, what your game or project is about, what are the main hard parts of your project)

The link to my notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQHBMQe0iyXwStNB7jln9pFZ5UlRox8HucosEY50QFU/edit) and the link to my slides are shown [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_nH9p6YSd68cVxDd3k3oh4iMql7FUC5hSoDr30NdnMw/edit?usp=sharing). I think my notes for the presentation didn't really do much for me since I didn't really elaborate on my speech but the different tips and advices I got from my peers really seemed to help me because I was struggling with what to add for my Beyond MVP for my project. I really like the idea of glows and grows from my classmates since they give me a different point of view of my project aside from just mines.
### Engineering Design Process
EDP process I'm currently on is the end because I have fully completed my project, I have done my beyond MVP and I have finished any changes needed for my project. Therefore, I'm only reviewing and learning from my own mistakes.
### Skills
Some skills that I think I learned along the way of creating and presenting my freedom project was fake it till you make it. I don't mean not learning your tool and acting like you do but all I'm saying is you have to know what your tool does and the main usage of the tool in your project. The other skill I learned is plan before hand when you have to present something or present to someone,
