# Plan
My official Tool for this Freedom Project would be "Jquery" and I want to make a scramble game with the tool so my first step would be thinking of the process and what I want the scramble to look like.
1. I would need a word bank where it gives the word and also the answer to the word
2. I would start off with a simple function where it gives me the timer
3. Make a function where it auto shuffles the words
4. A function where the words are corected and checked and displayed as an error whenever the player types in a wrong character
5. A refresh button and refreshes a word when
6. A check word button where it checks the word when you click on it (then goes to the checking words function)
